## Current status

Still improving the project. Core features are working, but UI and some edge cases can be improved. Planning to add more features and clean up the code.

---

## Notes

* Built this as a hands-on full-stack project
* Focused more on backend structure (controllers, routes, middleware)
* Frontend uses Context API for state management

---

## Future improvements

* Real-time messaging
* Better notifications system
* UI/UX improvements
